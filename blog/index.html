        <p>E.O. Wilson recently published an editorial entitled "Great scientists don't need math" in the Wall Street Journal. Jeremy Fox wrote a great rebuttal of it, which you should certainly read as well. In short, Wilson's argument is that most of great science is the work of intuition. In Jean Cocteau's words, science is the confirmation of instinct's discoveries. And in this perspective, math literacy is not needed, because it's only a boring formality, to confirm what the "great minds" have...</p>

        <p>High-throughput sequencing (let's abbreviate it as HTS), the ability to generate millions of sequences for a relatively low cost and effort, can make a huge difference in community ecology and biogeography. Think about it this way: for a few days of work, you can get a really exhaustive sampling of the diversity, with measures of relative abundance. I'm currently using 454 pyrosequencing in a project, and when I started reviewing the literature, I was stricken by the fact that there...</p>

        <p>Following yesterday's post on an alternative to barcharts, I decided to write an implementation of this graph in D3.js. The more I play around with it, the more I like it. As it turned out, it was fairly easy, so I'll share the code as a gist. For this particular example, I assume that the data are in a matrix, in csv format, with sites as the first row, and species abundances in columns. I also assume that the abudances...</p>

        <p>I hate stacked bar charts. I see them in so many papers, using the awful Excel default options, and I hate them. I feel them visually unappealing, confusing, and extremely inefficient at displaying information. It's almost impossible to compare the size of two bars without measuring them, which means that they carry less information than a good old table. So I was looking for alternatives to them. Here is the code I ended up with. First let's load a few...</p>

Also, I spent two hours this afternoon playing with D3.js, and I wanted to put what I've learnt in practice. What I want to do is remove each edge, and see how it affects modularity. This is, once again, really easy to do in networkx. We'll just write...</p>

        <p>I'm currently exploring a large network dataset for a project, and one of the things I want to do is estimate the contribution of each node to emerging networks properties. For example, if your network has an important modularity, which nodes are the most responsible for it? I'll just detail how it possible to get this information quickly using networkx.

        <p>COinS is a specification to embed metadata in web pages. In short, when these data are present, most bibliography software are able to add the resource to your library. Having these data in blog posts can be good, because you can keep track of blog posts with your other references, but you can also formally cite blog posts in your papers (if some people can turn blog posts into TREE papers, citing blog posts might not be so far away)....</p>

        <p>Caroline Tucker and Marc Cadotte recently had a great blog post discussing the reinvention of the ecological wheel, with special mention of the biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning (BEF) literature. I read this blog post with a lot of interest, for reasons that I will mention in a later post. The basic issue was that: Some of the findings in the BEF literature could be criticized as simply being rediscoveries of classical theory and experimental evidence already in existence. I'll keep my opinion about...</p>

There are possibly as many perspectives on this are there are researchers, which I'll definitely take as an excuse to present mine. Aim as high as you reasonably can.

Why a company (Mendeley) whose goal is to help scientist work, and faciliate access to papers, would associate with a company so despised by so many researchers that they are actively and publicly boycotting it (Elsevier) makes absolutely no sense. Some people on the Mendeley advisors group wanted to know more, and here is the reply we got: So it seemed like there...</p>

        <p>Most of my summer, and a substantial part of whatever time in fall was left after teaching, went into applying to various grants and positions. It's a frustrating experience, because it's time not spent doing research. But as I had no other possibility than doing it, I tried to make the experience enjoyable, and I even found myself learning a few things along the way. I've done my PhD in a French university, and it's very different from what happens...</p>

It's a great and exciting paper, in which we propose that bacteria-phage interactions should be studied as networks, rather than just pairs of interactions. Because the goal of the paper is to interest more people...</p>

        <p>Twitter is cool for science, because it can help you spread your ideas. And when you work with networks, Twitter is cool because it means a huge amount of data. With virtually no sampling effort. What has been said on the dynamics of, e.g., the Arab Spring, using social networks, was amazing, and I started developping a curiosity about what can be said about them with an ecological eye. I'm running pilots for a cool side project involving this kind...</p>

        <p>One big problem to people working with ecological networks is that most of the time, the data are not easy to get. Collections of food webs or mutualistic networks are passed from researcher to researcher, and it can be difficult to get your hands on a large database. Even if you have the data, you still have to put them in a "good" format, and it's not always an easy task. It implies looping through text files, putting the webs...</p>

        <p>I'm starting to organize a collection of notes and ideas I've had over the last year into an opinion paper about data sharing in ecology. In a word, we should share our data, and we should do it in a technically sound way - I'll tell more about these points later on. I was trying to illustrate the point that not sharing data is an absurdity, and to do so in a way that would be appealing to people. Let's...</p>

It was a really exciting event, where we discussed recent results on species interaction networks, and how we can use these networks to address the impact of global changes on communities and ecosystems. I presented some (still unpublished) results about how co-evolution and meta-community processes can lead to networks having a really complex structure. In parallel, I was working on our recent paper...</p>

In a recent paper, Cesar Flores and colleagues show rank-nestedness and rank-modularity curves, which is an interesting idea. But a point I really wanted to make is that a single network can deviate on both properties, and in both directions (which...</p>

Why? Because we were working on that system,...</p>

        <p>Python progressively replaced R for most of my daily simulations needs, because it's relatively fast, easy to write, and a pleasure to read. There are a lot of great packages for scientists, and since I started working on food webs seriously, I've been using networkx more and more. We've been having discussions in the lab about spatial graphs, surrounding a recent paper by Gilarranz and Bascompte and some of our own projects, and I thought that it will be fun...</p>

What would the electronic journal of the future look like in the field of Mathematics?

I have been thinking about this for the last few months (the earliest draft of this text dates back to early in february),...</p>

If the subject is interesting to you, I recommend the reading of a recent paper by Nico Mouquet and colleagues about Ecophylogenetics. But I'm not going to discuss the science in these papers. Rather, I would like to share some methodological / technical insights related to these questions. At times, one would like to re-analyze old data and...</p>

        <p>A few days ago, Jeremy Fox published on the Oikos blog, wondering if ecology was becoming too collaborative. The entry received a good number of comments, who mostly dealt with big, long terms collaborations. I can't really talk for this kind of collaborations, having not been in the business of science for long enough. But I was surprized that small, one shot (or at least, short term) collaborations, were not mentionned. For what it's worth, here is my contribution to...</p>

        <p>A few months ago — when finishing to write my thesis, as I grew increasingly disatisfied by the clumsiness of natbib —, I started looking into biblatex. biblatex is essentially a re-implementation of LaTeX packages like cite, natbib, and others. And the more I used it, the more I realized two things. First, biblatex is awesome; it's to natbib what knitr is to Sweave. Including the fact that switching from one system to the other is virtually transparent, but you...</p>

Not only it allowed me to have a backup of my chapters somewhere else than on my hard drive, but I could also revert back to a previous version of some paragraphs I liked better. Sometime during the summer, I discovered GitHub, and thought that I can give it a try. A few months later, I'm wondering what I would do without it....</p>

To do so, I've conceived two classes for the easy handling of phylogenetic structure. They are available on GitHub in the PyCoPhy repository (Python Community Phylogenetics), and check also the code page. The general idea behind them is quite easy to understand. A phylogenetic tree is a list of branchings. A...</p>

        <p>The final paper of my master's project was published online today in PLoS One. It's about how species of a fish parasite, which were defined based on morphological features, may not be actual species, as they have no phylogenetic support. Lamellodiscus Johnston &amp; Tiegs 1922 (Monogenea, Diplectanidae) is a genus of common parasites on the gills of sparid fishes. Here we show that this genus is probably undergoing a fast molecular diversification, as reflected by the important genetic variability observed within...</p>
